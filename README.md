# ftg_lib
This is my personal Altium component library.
No guarantee for correctness or anything is implied nor stated. 
Use at your own risk etc.
Components may be incomplete or just wrong.

This library is shared publicly because it's easier for me that way. 
The components and footprints created are for my personal projects and so on.

So for example I'm not selling RTL2832U, BK4811, RT5350F or RDA1846.
Do your own sourcing. :D

Give me a shout if you successfully use components from this library for something.
